# Self-supervised Audio-visual Co-segmentation



## Abstract

Segmenting objects in images and separating sound sources in au- dio are challenging tasks, in part because traditional approaches require large amounts of labeled data. In this paper we develop a neural network model for visual object segmentation and sound source separation that learns from natural videos through self-supervision. The model is an extension of recently proposed work that ***[maps image pixels to sounds](https://github.com/antony0621/Videos-Publications-Collection/blob/master/Multi-modalities/The_Sound_of_Pixels.md)***. Here, we introduce a learning approach to disentangle concepts in the neural networks, and assign semantic categories to network feature channels to enable independent image segmentation and sound source separation after audio-visual training on videos. Our evaluations show that the disentangled model outperforms several baselines in semantic segmentation and sound source separation.
