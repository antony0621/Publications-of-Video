# Video Textures

## Abstract

This paper introduces a new type of medium, called a video texture, which has qualities somewhere between those of a photograph and a video. A video texture provides a continuous infinitely varying stream of images. While the individual frames of a video texture may be repeated from time to time, the video sequence as a whole is never repeated exactly. Video textures can be used in place of digital photos to **infuse a static image with dynamic qualities and explicit action**. We present techniques for analyzing a video clip to extract its structure, and for **synthesizing a new, similar looking video** of arbitrary length. We combine video textures with view morphing techniques to obtain 3D video textures. We also introduce video-based animation, in which the synthesis of video textures can be guided by a user through high-level interactive controls. Applications of video textures and their extensions include the display of dynamic scenes on web pages, the creation of dynamic backdrops for special effects and games, and the interactive control of video-based animation.
